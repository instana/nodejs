# Changelog

## Unreleased
- [AWS Lambda] Detect Lambda cold starts.
- [AWS Lambda] Detect imminent Lambda timeouts heuristically.
- Instrumentation of AWS Lambda invoke function

## 1.121.0
- [AWS Lambda] Include Instana's [AWS Lambda extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/using-extensions.html) in the [Instana Node.js Lambda layer](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/aws-lambda/nodejs#instana-autotrace-setup). Monitoring data and traces are offloaded locally to Instana's Lambda extension, which will then forward it to the Instana back end. This feature is currently limited to Lambda functions configured with 256 MB of memory or more. Using the Instana Lambda extension can be disabled by setting the environment variable `INSTANA_DISABLE_LAMBDA_EXTENSION` to a non-empty string for a Lambda function.

## 1.120.0
- Add instrumentation for AWS Kinesis

## 1.119.5
- Let instrumented GRPC `ServiceClient` inherit from base client, fixes an issue with [`mali`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mali) up to version `0.20.0`.
- AWS SQS: remove duplicated instrumentation of receiveMessage in `sqs-consumer` instrumentation.

## 1.119.4
- Fix handling of null/undefined values used as exceptions/reasonswhen reporting uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections.

## 1.119.3
- Instrument `sqs-consumer` to capture exit child spans of SQS entries correctly.
- Add additional check in instrumentation for `@elastic/elasticsearch` to fix TypeError when no action is present.

## 1.119.2
- [AWS Fargate]: Fix secrets filtering for environment variables.
- [Google Cloud Run]: Fix secrets filtering for environment variables.

## 1.119.1
- Fixed a call from collector to the core by using @instana/collector instead of relative path

## 1.119.0
- Add instrumentation for Bull Messaging Framework.

## 1.118.0
- Update third party dependencies.

## 1.117.3
- Fix garbage collection metrics being reported falsely as not supported when `node_modules/gcstats.js` exists.

## 1.117.2
- Do not assume type local by default for OpenTracing spans. Instead, assume type entry when no parent context is available and only assume local if a parent context is available.
- Update to shimmer@1.2.1.

## 1.117.1
- Fix: Do not attempt to load native addons in a worker thread.

## 1.117.0
- [AWS Lambda] Reduce execution time overhead for native AWS Lambda tracing even further. (Bring back performance optimzation that was removed in 1.94.0 with a fix for the stale timeout events.)

## 1.116.0
- Add instrumentation for AWS DynamoDB.

## 1.115.0
- Add instrumentation for AWS S3.
- Update handling of W3C trace context headers to improve integration with OpenTelemetry.
- [AWS Lambda] Fix timeouts when the Lambda callback API without `context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop = false` is used and the Instana back end responds too slowly.

## 1.114.0
- Introduction of AWS SQS instrumentation for sending and reading messages.
- fix: run original function in runInAsyncContext/runPromiseInAsyncContext when tracing is not active.

## 1.113.0
- Instrument MongoDB native driver unified topology.
- Add configuration mechanism to disable copying of precompiled add-ons (`INSTANA_COPY_PRECOMPILED_NATIVE_ADDONS=false`).
- Make rebuilding native add-ons via node-gyp an opt-in feature (it is off by default now, use `INSTANA_REBUILD_NATIVE_ADDONS_ON_DEMAND=true` to enable it).

## 1.112.1
- Improve heuristic to detect npm or yarn.

## 1.112.0
- Remove `netlinkwrapper` dependency.
- Deprecate reporting uncaught exceptions as incidents and via span/trace. Prints a warning if the feature (which is opt-in) is enabled.

## 1.111.1:
- Avoid false positive warning about @instana/core being initialized too late in the presence of other instrumentation packages that need to be loaded before everything else.

## 1.111.0:
- Do not instrument npm or yarn when started via @instana/collector/src/immediate (instead, only instrument the child process started by npm start or yarn start).
- Do not instrument npm or yarn on AWS Fargate (instead, only instrument the child process started by npm start or yarn start).
- Do not instrument npm or yarn on Google Cloud Run (instead, only instrument the child process started by npm start or yarn start).

## 1.110.5:
- Depend on exact versions of `@instana` packages, not a version range. This makes sure all `@instana` packages are updated in sync and it avoids internal packages like `core` being updated while consuming packages like `collector` stay on an older version.

## 1.110.4
- Bring back core/util polyfill for Buffer.fromString for backwards compatibility.

## 1.110.3
- Exponential backoff retry strategy for failed announce attempts. This helps with agents that have not yet attached to the container (and thereby not seen the process) and thus will reject the very first announce attempt.
- Remove polyfill for Buffer.fromString (for Node.js versions up to 4.5 which we no longer support).

## 1.110.2
- Improve support for pino log calls that only receive a merging object argument.

## 1.110.1
- Fix Node.js 6 compatibility by downgrading `tar` dependency of `@instana/shared-metrics` from `tar@6` to `tar@5`.

## 1.110.0
- [Google Cloud Run]: Exclude some revision instance data from compression.

## 1.109.0
- Improve user experience around native add-on dependencies of `@instana/collector`:
    - Add precompiled archives for some combination of OS, architecture, libc-flavour and ABI-version.
    - Try to use the precompiled native add-on if loading a native add-on fails initially.
    - Try to rebuild the native add-on on demand as a fallback.

## 1.108.0
- Implement batching for very short (< 10 ms), high-frequency database spans (opt-in in this release, will be switched to default behaviour in one of the next releases). To enabled it right now, any of the three following methods can be used:
    - Set the environment variable `INSTANA_SPANBATCHING_ENABLED=true`.
    - Use in-code configuration: `config.tracing.spanBatchingEnabled: true`.
    - Add this to the agent's `configuration.yaml`:

      ```
      com.instana.plugin.nodejs:
        span-batching-enabled: true
      ```
- [AWS Lambda] Check type of Lambda error messages and stringify if necessary.

## 1.107.0
- Add instrumentation for [`@google-cloud/pubsub`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/pubsub).

## 1.106.6
- Fix (Elasticsearch): Adapt instrumentation for `@elastic/elasticsearch` for refactoring of `api` submodule introduced in `@elastic/elasticsearch@7.9.1`. (Fixes `TypeError: Cannot set property 'Symbol(configuration error)' of undefined`.) Also, remove obsolete `stats` annotation for `elasticsearch` spans.
- Remove longer span reporting interval for serverless tracers, use standard interval instead.

## 1.106.5
- [Google Cloud Run]: Minor changes for the upcoming Google Cloud Run support. Requires at least Instana back end version 189.

## 1.106.4
- Remove direct `node-fetch` dependency from `@instana/aws-fargate` as well as `@instana/google-cloud-run` and move it to `@instana/metrics-util` instead.
- Optimization: Only set `span.data.service` on first span.
- Send `span.crid`/`span.crtp` instead of `span.data.correlationId`/`span.data.correlationType`.

## 1.106.3
- Fix: Move `event-loop-lag` from optionalDependencies to dependencies, so installations with `--ignore-optional` will work correctly. ([#258](https://github.com/instana/nodejs-sensor/pull/258), thanks to @ThisIsMissEm).
- [AWS Fargate]: Update dependency `node-fetch` version 2.6.1 (fixes https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1556).

## 1.106.2
- [AWS Fargate]: Make optional dependencies on native add-ons truely optional (do not break the Docker build on `RUN /instana/setup.sh`).
- Fix: Propagate `X-INSTANA-L: 0` downstream with AMQP headers.

## 1.106.1
- Fix bogus warning about invalid configuration emitted during startup (`"Invalid configuration: config.tracing.http.extraHttpHeadersToCapture is not an array, the value will be ignored: {}"`).
- [Google Cloud Run]: *Experimental* in-process data collection for Google Cloud Run services via the new package `@instana/google-cloud-run`. Requires at least Instana back end version 185. `@instana/google-cloud-run` supports Node.js 8.6.0 or later. Note that this is an early technical preview and not ready for general usage. At this time, no support can be provided for this new package. This will change once Google Cloud Run support becomes generally available with Instana.

## 1.106.0
- Fix(HTTP1/Server): Also set Server-Timing header when X-INSTANA-T is incoming (that is, not only when we start a fresh trace).
- Fix(HTTP1/Server): Do not append another intid key-value pair to Server-Timing if it is already present.
- Fix(HTTP2/Server): Add support for website monitoring back end correlation via Server-Timing header.
- Fix(HTTP2/Server): Add support for X-Instana-Service.
- Fix(HTTP2/Server): Inject the trace ID into the request to enable application code to inject it into the response body.
- Fix(HTTP2/Server): Use case-insensitive header matching as incoming headers are already normalized to lower case (performance improvement).
- Add support for `INSTANA_EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS` variable.
- Fix(HTTP1/HTTP2): Fix handling for headers of type array (normalize to string, separated by 0x2C 0x20).
- [AWS Fargate] Add support for `INSTANA_ZONE`.
- [AWS Fargate] Add support for `INSTANA_TAGS`.
- Secrets Filtering: Replace values for filtered query parameters with `<redacted>` instead of removing the whole key-value pair.

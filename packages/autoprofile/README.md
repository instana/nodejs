## AutoProfile™

**This is an internal package. Please do not add it to your dependencies directly. Instead, use `@instana/collector`, which includes this package as a dependency.**

AutoProfile™ generates and reports process profiles to Instana. Unlike development-time and on-demand profilers, where a user must manually initiate profiling, AutoProfile™ automatically schedules and continuously performs profiling appropriate for critical production environments.

Follow our [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-nodejs#autoprofile) for more information.

# Remark: You will need to change the domain in two places (subj and config/subjectAltName) if the app is deployed on a
# different server. If you want to access the app in your browser you also need to add the cert to your trusted certs
# locally:

# 1. Open the app "Keychain Access"
# 2. drag your certificate from Finder into Keychain Access,
# 3. go into the certificates section and locate the certificate you just added,
# 4. double click it, enter the trust section and under “When using this certificate” select “Always Trust”.

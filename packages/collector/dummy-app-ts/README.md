# Typescript Dummy App

This is a Node.js + Typescript merely used to test the intellisense when the Instana SDK is used.

Because our tracer is written in Javascript with types provided in JS Doc format and declaration files generated from
them, we want to make sure that customers using Typescript will benefit from auto completion and be able to inspect
types from our public SDK.

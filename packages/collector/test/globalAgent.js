// This module manages the global agent stub, that is, the agent that is kept running during the whole test suite.
// Individual sub suites/tests can opt in to use this global instance or start and stop an agent stub on their own,
// depending on their requirements. Using the global instance is preferred as it decreases the duration of the
// @instana/collector test suite as a whole.
//
// The module ../globalHooks_test sets up the global Mocha hooks that make sure the agent is started before running the
// test suite and stopped afterwards.

// running in the context of @instana/collector).  Individual suites/tests/ that start an agent themselves and tear it
// down  afterwards use 3210. Other packages that use the global agent follow a similar pattern, see
// test-suite-ports.md. All packages that want to use the global agent need to declare the port they use here.

/**
 * We currently only instrument CJS modules. As soon as we want
 * to instrument ES modules (such as `got` v12), the requireHook will
 * no longer work. Therefor we would need to wrap the target ES module
 * with our instrumentations using the resolve & load hook.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ENV NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-loader=/instana/node_modules/
 * @instana/aws-fargate/esm-loader.mjs'
 *
 * NOTE: When using ESM, the customers have the option to set up the aws-fargate
 * by configuring ENV variable within the docker file. Given that aws-fargate 
 * self-initializes, its current utilization remains unchanged.
 * However, there's potential for future integration where the init() method 
 * can be invoked from this context.
